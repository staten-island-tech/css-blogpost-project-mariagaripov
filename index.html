        <h2>Cats are such adorable and funny creatures. I think every single cat is great, but these stand out.</h2>

        <h1>Sphynx Cats</h1>
        <p>Hairless cats get hated on all the time, but I think they deserve so much more love. They look like little skin bags running around and it is absolutely hilarious.</p>

        <h1>Persian Cats</h1>
        <p class= "description2">Persian cats are pretty much the opposite of hairless cats, and they are adorabe. Nothing can compare to the beautiful long fur of persian cats. </p>

        <h1>Black Cats</h1>
        <p class= "description3">Black cats are so insanely cute. Their eyes always look so pretty against their fur, and look like little panthers. I do have a slight bias for black cats because I have one, but i believe they also deserve more love, because  they are NOT bad luck, and if anything i think they are super spiritual. </p>
