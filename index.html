    <h1 class= "head">top 3 american horror story seasons</h1>
    <div class="background"></div>
        <h2>all of the seasons were good in their own way. except freak show.</h2>
    <h3 class= "post1">murder house</h3>
        <p class="description1">the plot line was pretty intersting, but it just wasn't at all scary or unsettling really in my opinion. And a lot of the characters were very unlikeable.</p>
    <h4 class="post2">asylum</h4>
        <p class= "description2">Asylum had a really intense and cultivating storyline. However, it is not in the number 1 spot because of how slowely the storyline went. I guess some people enjoy intriquite stories like that, but it's not for me and my short attention span </p>
    <h5 class= "post3">hotel</h5>
        <p class= "descriptio">this is a contreversial take. I love hotel mainly because of lady gagas character, who sold the whole season for me. It was also pretty terrifying without dragging out it's plot.</p>
